This code is based on the Tutorial #19 http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/recipes/cortical_maps/
The cortical maps and connectivity .txt are modified, but the parsemap script is used. 

The files in this folder replicate the circos plots for the ABIDE dataset, Brainnetome parcellation. Other parcellations and UCLA dataset, see the subfolders.

The tutorial has been previously used in:
